# **Stacks, Heaps, and Queues**

Data structures like stacks, heaps, and queues are fundamental in a wide range of coding interview problems. By understanding how they work and seeing their real-world applications, you’ll be better prepared to tackle everything from scheduling tasks to handling function calls and priority-based data retrieval.

---

## **1. Stacks**

A **stack** follows the *Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)* principle: the most recently added item is the first to be removed. Common operations and their typical time complexities are:

- **Push**: O(1)  
- **Pop**: O(1)  
- **Peek/Top**: O(1)  
- **IsEmpty**: O(1)

### **1.1 Real-World Examples**
- **Function Call Stack**: Programming languages maintain a call stack to track active function calls, local variables, and return addresses.  
- **Undo/Redo Feature**: Text editors keep a history of operations in a stack. When you press “undo,” the most recent change is popped from the stack and reverted.

### **1.2 Coding a Basic Stack in Go**

Below is a simple, generic approach to creating a stack of `int` in Go. For a real interview, you may need to illustrate how you’d handle errors or dynamic capacity.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

type Stack struct {
    items []int
}

// Push adds an element to the top of the stack
func (s *Stack) Push(value int) {
    s.items = append(s.items, value)
}

// Pop removes and returns the top element of the stack
func (s *Stack) Pop() (int, bool) {
    if len(s.items) == 0 {
        return 0, false // or handle error
    }
    topIndex := len(s.items) - 1
    top := s.items[topIndex]
    s.items = s.items[:topIndex]
    return top, true
}

// Peek returns the top element without removing it
func (s *Stack) Peek() (int, bool) {
    if len(s.items) == 0 {
        return 0, false
    }
    return s.items[len(s.items)-1], true
}

// IsEmpty returns whether the stack is empty
func (s *Stack) IsEmpty() bool {
    return len(s.items) == 0
}

func main() {
    stack := &Stack{}

    stack.Push(10)
    stack.Push(20)
    stack.Push(30)

    top, _ := stack.Peek()
    fmt.Println("Top element:", top) // 30

    popped, _ := stack.Pop()
    fmt.Println("Popped element:", popped) // 30

    fmt.Println("Stack is empty?", stack.IsEmpty())
}
```

## **2. Heaps**

A **heap** is typically used to implement a *priority queue*. It’s a tree-based structure where parents always have a higher priority (max-heap) or lower priority (min-heap) than their children. For coding interviews, the min-heap variant is very common.

### **2.1 Real-World Examples**
- **Priority Queues**: Scheduling tasks by priority in an operating system.  
- **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstra’s algorithm (and other shortest-path searches) often use a min-priority queue to retrieve the next edge with minimal weight.

### **2.2 Time Complexities**
- **Insertion**: O(log n) (due to heapify-up)  
- **Get/Remove Top**: O(log n) (due to heapify-down)  
- **Peek Top**: O(1)

### **2.3 Implementing a Min-Heap in Go**

Go provides a package `container/heap` that simplifies heap usage by defining an interface for any type that implements `Len()`, `Less()`, `Swap()`, etc. Here’s a minimal example of a priority queue using Go’s built-in heap interface:

```go
package main

import (
    "container/heap"
    "fmt"
)

// An Item defines the value and priority for each element in the heap
type Item struct {
    value    string
    priority int
}

// A PriorityQueue implements the heap.Interface and holds Items
type PriorityQueue []*Item

func (pq PriorityQueue) Len() int { return len(pq) }

// For a min-heap, Less should return true if priority is smaller
func (pq PriorityQueue) Less(i, j int) bool {
    return pq[i].priority < pq[j].priority
}

func (pq PriorityQueue) Swap(i, j int) {
    pq[i], pq[j] = pq[j], pq[i]
}

// Push and Pop use pointer receivers because they modify the slice's length
func (pq *PriorityQueue) Push(x interface{}) {
    *pq = append(*pq, x.(*Item))
}

func (pq *PriorityQueue) Pop() interface{} {
    old := *pq
    n := len(old)
    item := old[n-1]
    *pq = old[:n-1]
    return item
}

func main() {
    items := []*Item{
        {value: "Clean the house", priority: 3},
        {value: "Do the laundry", priority: 1},
        {value: "Pay bills", priority: 2},
    }

    pq := make(PriorityQueue, len(items))
    for i, item := range items {
        pq[i] = item
    }
    heap.Init(&pq) // Build heap from items

    // Add a new item
    newItem := &Item{
        value:    "Buy groceries",
        priority: 0, // highest priority
    }
    heap.Push(&pq, newItem)

    // Pop items by increasing priority
    for pq.Len() > 0 {
        item := heap.Pop(&pq).(*Item)
        fmt.Printf("Popped item: %s (priority %d)\n",
            item.value, item.priority)
    }
}
```

In this code:

1. We define an `Item` with a `priority`.  
2. We implement a `PriorityQueue` that satisfies Go’s `heap.Interface`.  
3. Higher priority tasks have a *lower* integer value, hence the `Less` function compares the `priority` field.  
4. We use `heap.Init` to transform our slice into a heap.  
5. `heap.Push` and `heap.Pop` handle insertion and removal in **O(log n)** time.

## **3. Queues**

A **queue** follows the *First-In, First-Out (FIFO)* principle: elements are removed in the same order they were added. Common operations:

- **Enqueue**: O(1)  
- **Dequeue**: O(1)  
- **Peek**: O(1)  
- **IsEmpty**: O(1)

### **3.1 Real-World Examples**
- **Request Handling**: Web servers use request queues to process incoming requests in order.  
- **Messaging Systems**: Queues ensure messages are processed in a first-come, first-served manner.

### **3.2 Implementing a Queue in Go**

Below is a straightforward slice-based implementation of a queue of `int`. For an interview, you might be asked to demonstrate how you’d handle resizing when the slice is full or how to implement a circular buffer.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

type Queue struct {
    items []int
}

func (q *Queue) Enqueue(value int) {
    q.items = append(q.items, value)
}

func (q *Queue) Dequeue() (int, bool) {
    if len(q.items) == 0 {
        return 0, false
    }
    front := q.items[0]
    q.items = q.items[1:]
    return front, true
}

func (q *Queue) Peek() (int, bool) {
    if len(q.items) == 0 {
        return 0, false
    }
    return q.items[0], true
}

func (q *Queue) IsEmpty() bool {
    return len(q.items) == 0
}

func main() {
    queue := &Queue{}
    queue.Enqueue(10)
    queue.Enqueue(20)

    front, _ := queue.Peek()
    fmt.Println("Front item:", front) // 10

    dequeued, _ := queue.Dequeue()
    fmt.Println("Dequeued item:", dequeued) // 10
    fmt.Println("Is queue empty?", queue.IsEmpty())
}
```

## **4. Interview Tips and Common Pitfalls**

1. **Demonstrate Complexity Understanding**  
   Clearly state:  
   - **Stack**: O(1) push/pop.  
   - **Heap (Priority Queue)**: O(log n) insert/remove.  
   - **Queue**: O(1) enqueue/dequeue (assuming no resizing overhead).  

2. **Implement from Scratch When Asked**  
   Interviewers often want to see that you can implement these structures manually. Show how to store elements, maintain pointers (front/rear for a queue, top for a stack), and handle edge cases (empty structure).

3. **Optimize for Your Use Case**  
   - If you need random access, a heap structure is not ideal.  
   - If you need quick insertion and retrieval of the most recently added item, use a stack.  
   - If you need first-come, first-served processing, use a queue.

4. **Avoid Common Mistakes**  
   - **Stack**: Confusing push/pop order.  
   - **Heap**: Getting the `Less` function backwards (accidentally implementing a max-heap when you need a min-heap).  
   - **Queue**: Using naive slicing for dequeue can lead to performance hits if done repeatedly without reusing spaces (though Go’s slice is typically reallocated eventually—still, for extremely large queues, a linked-list or cyclic buffer could be more efficient).

## **5. Key Takeaways**

1. **Stack (LIFO)**  
   - Essential for problems requiring reversal or tracking the most recent element (e.g., balancing parentheses, undo features).  
   - O(1) insertion/removal at the top.

2. **Heap (Priority Queue)**  
   - Used to always retrieve the highest or lowest priority item first.  
   - Insert/Remove in O(log n). Great for scheduling, pathfinding algorithms, and any priority-based retrieval.

3. **Queue (FIFO)**  
   - Perfect for tasks that must be processed in the order they arrive (e.g., BFS in graphs, job scheduling fundamentals).  
   - O(1) enqueue/dequeue in ideal conditions.

Understanding these data structures with hands-on coding and knowing when to apply them is a significant advantage in interviews. You’ll often see them used in combination with other concepts (like graph traversals or dynamic programming) to solve complex challenges efficiently.
